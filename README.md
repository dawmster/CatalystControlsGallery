# Catalyst Controls Gallery

Very simple work-in-progress demonstration of many common controls available to Mac Catalyst as of macOS 11. Provided moreso as a jumping off point for advanced developers than sample code intended for beginners, as it mixes and matches UIKit & SwiftUI where necessary. This is also designed with macOS in mind, and may not be expected to work as-is on iOS or iPadOS.
